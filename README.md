# :construction_worker: Lights :hammer:

Found out recently that the Philips Hue Bridge has a [RESTful
API](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/hue-api/) so naturally I needed to
write a CLI to control my lights.

## Work in progress

I've only just started working on this so I'll update the README with
installation instructions and all that soon.

## Usage

```
lights on     [all] [<light name/id>...]
       off    [all] [<light name/id>...]
       toggle [all] [<light name/id>...]
       show   [lights] [groups] [scenes]
       help
```
